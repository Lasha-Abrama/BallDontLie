# Lasha-Abramishvili

This Python script utilizes the "balldontlie" API to fetch basketball player data, which is then stored in a SQLite database.

The script retrieves player information, including their ID, firstname, lastname, position, and team, and inserts it into the database. It also provides functionality to read and print the stored player data.

To use the script, simply run it(python basketball_players.py), and it will handle fetching data from the API, storing it in the basketball_players.db database, and displaying the player details.

Requirements include Python 3.x, the requests library, and the sqlite3 library.
